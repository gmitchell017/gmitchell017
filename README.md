Hi There! My name is Gage and I am studying Chemical Engineering at The University of Texas at San Antonio. I am currently in my sophomore year and am on track to graduate by May 2027.

I enjoy engineering and chemical projects, and am looking forward to getting into the programming and computer engineering scene, as I am taking an introductory programming course at my school.

I will be using Github to explore other people's project and get insight on how coding for computers work and be able to have a better understanding of it consuming how little I know.

I can be reached on Instagram @gagemitchell017 and personal phone number is asked privately.
